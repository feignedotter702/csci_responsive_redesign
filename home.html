      <h2 class="heading">The Room Official Site</h2>
      <p class="btext">This is the official website of a movie website. It was released in 2003 and is mainly used to post information about the movie release, production, screening ceremony, and the sale of movie peripherals. Every few years, information about the film's tour will be posted on this site.</p>
      <p class="btext">I redesigned the The Room official web page to be responsive across various device sizes while improving the site’s usability and visual design.</p>

        <h2 class="heading"> Current Issues </h2>
        <h3 class="btext"> Usability </h3>
        <p class="btext">Performing a heuristic evaluation and analyzing the site based on criteria of usability, learnability, and memorability revealed many issues with the page’s visual design and lack of responsiveness.</p>

        <h3 class="btext"> Accessibility </h3>
        <!-- <p class="btext">A Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool resulted in 44 errors on the site (mostly due to empty headings), 1,197 contrast errors (due to the white text on a light colored background) and 47 alerts (due to suspicious links).</p> -->

        <img src="error2.png" alt="the current website." class="image" id="large">
        <p class="btext">When using a screen reader to assess the site’s accessibility for people who are visually impaired, the lack of alternative titles made it impossible to understand images. The use of empty headings and lack of hierarchy between headings and text also made comprehension difficult.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="heading"> Visual Redesign </h2>
        <h3 class="btext"> Low-Fidelity Wireframes </h3>
        <p class="btext">Created with Balsamiq, the following wireframes display a simple low-fidelity representation of the page’s redesign. The annotations describe where and how the wireframes solve the issues associated with the current site.</p>

        <h3 class="btext"> High-Fidelity Prototypes </h3>
        <p class="btext">Created with Figma, the following high-fidelity mock-ups realistically prototype the low-fidelity wireframes. The annotations describe how developers can reproduce the elements in HTML and CSS and implement responsiveness across three common device widths.</p>
